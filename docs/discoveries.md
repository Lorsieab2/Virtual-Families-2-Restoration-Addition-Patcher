## 2026-07-02 - Offline Patcher Foundation

- `work/offline_vf2_patcher.py` is the source-only patcher scaffold for the
  no-modified-EXE release path.
- Patch manifests are JSON and currently support length-preserving byte records
  with `file_path`, `offset`, `expected_original_bytes`, `replacement_bytes`,
  and `note`.
- Manifests can declare toggleable settings such as `holiday_furniture`,
  `holiday_outfits`, and `mobile_furniture`; byte patches and target-file checks
  can require those settings before becoming active.
- `work/offline_vf2_patcher_gui.py` is a Tkinter front end that generates
  checkboxes directly from manifest settings and calls the same apply/restore
  functions as the CLI.
- The patcher verifies target-file metadata and expected bytes before writing,
  creates a backup manifest, writes patch/restore logs, and restores from its
  own backup folder.

## 2026-07-02 - Save-Load Crash In Debug Mouse-Move Hook

- B58, B59, and B60 WER reports share exception `0xc0000005` at module offset
  `0x0009ff8b`.
- In B60 bytes, RVA `0x9ff70` is the patched
  `theMainScene::HandleMouseMove(ldwPoint)` prologue. Offset `0x9ff8b` lands
  inside the injected `_VF2PatchedDebuggerMouseMove` early-return sequence
  (`pop ebp; ret 8`), not in General Appliances count logic.
- B61 removes the mouse-move debug-editor hook so loaded saves keep the stock
  `theMainScene::HandleMouseMove -> CFurnitureManager::HandleMouseMove ->
  CToolTray::HandleMouseMove` flow. Mouse down/up/key debug hooks remain
  available for editor entry points.
- B61 still crashes on mouse click after loading a save, which points to the
  remaining main-scene mouse down/up debugger hooks touching debugger/editor
  state during vanilla play.
- B62 changes the debugger input hooks to fall through to stock handlers unless
  F5 has enabled debugger input for the session, and wraps `Debugger`/`IEditor`
  calls with guarded access that disables debugger input after an access fault.
- The local B62 signing attempt reached `signtool` but failed because the
  configured certificate thumbprint was not present in the current user's
  certificate store.
- B62 still crashes while opening the affected save, so B63 disables debugger
  hooks by default and leaves all `theMainScene` save-load/draw/input handlers
  stock in normal builds. Debugger work should move to isolated opt-in research
  builds.
- B63's generated `work/patched_mobile_furniture_pack_objs/theMainScene.obj`
  matches `work/desktop_obj_files/theMainScene.obj` byte-for-byte by SHA-256,
  confirming the normal build no longer patches `theMainScene`.

## 2026-07-02 - General Appliances Count Collision

- `gAppliancesList` stock count is `15` (`0x0F`), with max index `14`
  (`0x0E`).
- After additive pet support, `gPetList` also has count `15`; broad patching of
  `6A 0F` or `83 FE 0E` can widen pet paths while trying to add VF3 TVs.
- Safe General Appliances widening is now targeted to
  `CInventoryManager::GetCategoryItem` offsets `0x73` and `0x95`, plus
  `CInventoryManager::GetCategoryItemCount` offset `0x37`.
- Accessories worked with the earlier pattern approach because its stock count
  `47` was distinctive in the patched object, but that should not be treated as
  safe for small/common category counts.
